PATIENT MANAGER BACKEND

Project Description

The Patient Manager Backend is a comprehensive API designed to manage patient records and related data. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting patient information and their medical records. It follows best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security.

Thought Process Behind the Implementation

The implementation of the Patient Manager Backend was guided by the following principles:
1.	Separation of Concerns: The application is divided into multiple layers (Domain, Core, Infrastructure, and Presentation) to ensure a clear separation of responsibilities. This makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
2.	Dependency Injection: Services and repositories are registered in the dependency injection container to promote loose coupling and enhance testability.
3.	Configuration Management: Configuration settings are managed using the appsettings.json file and strongly-typed configuration classes. This approach ensures that configuration values are easily accessible and modifiable.
4.	Error Handling: Custom middleware is used to handle exceptions globally, providing a consistent error response format and logging errors for troubleshooting.
5.	Database Management: Entity Framework Core is used for database interactions, with migrations enabled to manage database schema changes.
6.	Automated Testing: Unit tests are written for services and repositories to ensure the correctness of the business logic and data access layer.

Key Design Decisions

1.	Layered Architecture: The application is structured into distinct layers:
	Domain: Contains the core entities and enums.
	Core: Contains the business logic, DTOs, repositories, and interfaces.
	Infrastructure: Contains configuration classes.
	Persistence: Contains the Database section.
    The main application contains the controllers.
2.	Entity Framework Core: Chosen for its seamless integration with ASP.NET Core and its powerful ORM capabilities. SQLite is used as the database provider for simplicity and ease of setup.
3.	AutoMapper: Used to simplify the mapping between entities and DTOs, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring consistency.
4.	Swagger for API Documentation: Swagger is configured to generate interactive API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and test the API.
5.	Custom Exception Middleware: A custom middleware is implemented to handle exceptions globally, providing a unified error response format and logging errors for easier debugging.

Conclusion

The Patient Manager Backend is designed with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and security. By following best practices and leveraging powerful libraries and frameworks, the application provides a robust foundation for managing patient data.
